# 🏋️ Gym Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Insights  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **4,000 gym members** to identify the key drivers of churn and provide actionable retention strategies.  
The analysis was performed using **Python (Pandas)** for data cleaning and **Power BI** for interactive dashboards.  

**Goal:** Understand why customers leave (churn) and generate insights that help the gym improve retention and customer loyalty.

## 📊 Key KPIs  
- **Total Customers:** 4,000  
- **Churn Rate:** 26.53%  
- **Retention Rate:** 73.48%  
- **Average Lifetime:** 3.72 months

## 🔎 Insights  

### Demographics  
- Younger customers (<25 yrs) churn the most (75% → 36%), while older members churn much less (25–35 yrs: 11.77%, 30–35 yrs: 2.13%).  
- Male vs Female churn is almost equal (~26%).  
- Customers with a partner churn less (**19.36%**) than those without (**33.32%**).  

### Contract & Location  
- **1-month contracts** → Highest churn (**42.32%**).  
- **12-month contracts** → Very low churn (**2.40%**).  
- Members **near gym** churn less (**24.11%**) compared to those living far (**39.74%**).  

### Engagement & Spending  
- **Group visits reduce churn**: With groups → 17.28%, Without groups → 33.01%.  
- **Class frequency declining**: Overall avg = 1.88 → Current month = 1.77.  
- **Spending behavior matters**: Low spenders churn 33.78%, High spenders churn only 18.02%.  

### Lifetime & Retention  
- Early exits are common → 82% churn at month 0, 49% at month 1.  
- After 3 months, churn drops significantly.  
- Retention falls to **57.68%** when contracts near expiry.  

### Customer Segmentation  
- **High churn risk:** Under 25 yrs + low engagement (~69%).  
- **Medium risk:** Far location + short contract (~51%).  
- **Low churn risk:** Referral + group visits (~10.68%).

## ✅ Recommendations  
- Promote **longer contracts (6–12 months)** with discounts.  
- Design **youth engagement programs** (gamification, challenges, loyalty rewards).  
- Encourage **referrals & group workouts** with buddy passes and referral bonuses.  
- Focus on **early engagement (first 3 months)** with onboarding support and trial classes.  
- Provide **personalized offers** to low spenders.  
- Offer **hybrid membership models** (online + offline) for customers far from the gym.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques  
- **Python:** Data cleaning & preprocessing (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Power BI:** KPI dashboards, churn analysis visuals  
- **DAX:** Custom measures (Churn %, Retention %, Segmentation)  
- **Business Analysis:** Insights & recommendations for retention strategy
